# Talks

This is a list of programming-related talks I've given.

## Miscellaneous Meetups

When I'm travelling I'll often go to meetups in other cities, sometimes I give talks.

- [Algorithms in Rust](https://speakerdeck.com/trishume/algorithms-in-rust): Presented at the Bay Area Rust Meetup. Contains tips and tools about writing compute-heavy code in Rust.
- Heresy: at NYC Emacs I gave a short talk about why Sublime Text can be better than Emacs. Content was similar to [this post](/2017/03/04/my-text-editor-journey-vim-spacemacs-atom-and-sublime-text/).

## UWaterloo CS Club

I occasionally give talks for the UWaterloo CS club, mostly at the Alt+Tab short talks events:

- [Unix 201](http://csclub.uwaterloo.ca/events/MC_4045-2017-03-22-6:00_pm): This one didn't have slides but [there's a list of things I talked about](https://gist.github.com/trishume/fb1c80f61c9a62426a6565a9f661e449)
