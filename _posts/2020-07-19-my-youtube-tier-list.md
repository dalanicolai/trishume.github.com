# A Tier: Highly recommended

[Tech Ingredients](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCVSHXNNBitaPd5lYz48--yg)
: Long and detailed technical videos of interesting projects demonstrating cool science and engineering concepts. They build really high quality demonstration pieces for each video. Lots of the concepts they look into are little known ones like [magnetohydrodynamics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LS3GQk9ETRU), how [helium is an incredibly good sound suppressor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxOzpPJbnTI) and [plasma physics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcpDGKH9_SE). The main presenter is super knowledgeable and every video has some really interesting things. It's a bit slow paced but you can fix that by always watching on 2x speed. They also just posted a [Best Of clips compilation video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bRr8lrUc-GI).

[Practical Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCMOqf8ab-42UUQIdVoKwjlQ)
: Explains interesting things from civil engineering often with cool models and demonstrations. I found [this one on hydraulic ram pumps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zFdyqTGx32A) really cool.

[Dan Gelbart](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYA1VjSKXgNVh03wjw_HSRA)
: Dan is an incredible engineer who made a fortune selling companies and now has an amazing machine shop, with lots of tools he's built or modified himself. He doesn't post videos very often but the main draw of his channel is the 7 year old 19-part series on tools and techniques for building prototypes. It's a masterpiece of incredible knowledge, impressive designs and great tips. I recently rewatched the whole series.

[NightHawkInLight](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFtc3XdXgLFwhlDajMGK69w)
: Videos of small interesting projects [beautifully](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tcV1EYSUQME) filmed and explained. I particularly liked this one about [making a carbon filament light bulb](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThBkzEfjVl0).

[The Thought Emporium](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV5vCi3jPJdURZwAOO_FNfQ)
: Lots of different types of DIY science projects including DIY genetic engineering. In his craziest video he [engineers a benign virus to put lactase genes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3FcbFqSoQY) in his intestines to cure his lactose intolerance for a long time (most of the video is explaining why what he did was reasonably safe). More recently he's been uploading long live streams but look back a bit for the shorter science project videos.

[Primitive Technology](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA)
: Guy goes out into the woods in Australia and makes pottery, metal, shelter, tools and materials starting with no tools at all. This video about [making a kiln to smelt iron](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RnvtXikwrIU) is really good.

[NileRed](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCFhXFikryT4aFcLkLw2LBLA)
: Beautiful and interesting videos about chemistry accessible to someone who knows very little about chemistry.

[This Old Tony](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5NO8MgTQKHAWXp6z8Xl7yQ)
: Really well-produced entertaining and funny machine shop and engine videos that usually use some small machining project to explain a concept.

[Steve Mould](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=975r9a7FMqc)
: Interesting science concept explanation videos with demonstrations. I was waffling between A and B tier but [this phenomenally cool recent video on optical rotation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=975r9a7FMqc) blew me away and secured his spot in A tier.


# B Tier: Very Good

[The Hacksmith](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjgpFI5dU-D1-kh9H1muoxQ)
: Skilled engineers with a substantial budget and machine shop try to make real life versions of gadgets from fiction. Their main audience is kids and non-technical people and it shows, but many of their videos have pretty cool engineering, and their build montages are neat.

[Technology Connections](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy0tKL1T7wFoYcxCe0xjN6Q)
: Guy explains interesting bits of technological history and science behind everyday gadgets. Like [this video on how rice cookers use some neat physics tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RSTNhvDGbYI).

[Tier Zoo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHsRtomD4twRf5WVHHk-cMw)
: A biologist explains interesting animal facts as funny parodies of video game commentary and tier lists (I am partial to the tier list format as evidenced by this very tier list). [This one on turtles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9a-OAQE_hMQ) is pretty good.

[Sam Zeloof](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7E8-0Ou69hwScPW1_fQApA)
: One of the only people to successfully [produce a silicon integrated circuit at home](https://youtu.be/XrEC2LGGXn0?t=25), and when he was in high school. This year he started putting out high-effort videos on [cool equipment](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nxz_ENnmgtI) used in the process.

[Tom Stanton](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC67gfx2Fg7K2NSHqoENVgwA)
: Implements really creative and cool engineering ideas mostly using a lot of 3D printing. Some of his coolest videos are building drones using weird things like [gas thrusters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpA6qpNlNOE), [reaction wheels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kfBEaTncjI), [the Coanda effect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Irp_vnmUWZ4) and [a single rotor with no swashplate](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d80oXSCcHTk).

[Demoscene High-Quality Videos](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC96JVq-z0-0iHAkIkKp1_6w)
: 64k intros, where people write programs that produce beautiful visuals and audio using an executable less than 64 kilobytes, are perhaps my favorite art form accross all art forms. They often use very non-standard rendering techniques that lead to unique visuals, have good electronic background tracks, and the whole time I marvel at the technical wizardry of the tiny size. Not all the best videos are on this channel and not all the ones on this channel are good but it has many good ones. My favorite intro group is Logicoma, even before I found out they use Rust. My favorites of their stuff: [Engage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjuridCR2Fo), [Dope On Wax](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhqT0DhV9yE), [Trash Panda](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gVHktHeYsfs) and [Elysian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rWwNgVwQG1A).
Favorites by other groups include
[on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XF4SEVbxUdE),
[Zetsubo (4k!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncdA3t_vzF8&t=100s),
[delight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UnjIMd3kVf4),
[Offscreen Colonies](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mjzeP7hYyNo) and [the timeless](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ie4u2i_5OdE).

[CNLohr](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG7yIWtVwcENg_ZS-nahg5g)
: Really interesting and cool electronics projects. Examples include [reverse engineering the HTC Vive and making a custom Linux C SDK for it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2DjjG9wVY0), [running a custom Minecraft server on a microcontroller](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R1zx0xV0pWw) and [pretty LEDs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOP8I-7rA_8).

[Inigo Quilez](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdmAhiG8HQDlz8uyekw4ENw)
: Inigo is famous for his [excellent website](https://www.iquilezles.org/) with lots of computer graphics tips especially around [signed distance fields](https://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/raymarchingdf/raymarchingdf.htm). More recently he's been uploading [high effort explanations](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMltMdi1Wzg), [live coding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sl9x19EnKng) and [pretty fractals](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQ2bnU4dkso) to his YouTube channel.

[Tom7/suckerpinch](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC3azLjQuz9s5qk76KEXaTvA)
: Tom7 is known for his incredibly good high-effort [SIGBOVIK technical joke conference papers](http://radar.spacebar.org/f/a/weblog/category/1/sigbovik). What I only learned later is often he makes [great funny YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar9WRwCiSr0) explaining his crazy hacks like.

[Real Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCR1IuLEqb6UEA_zQ81kwXfg)
: Well-produced and interesting explanation videos on various engineering topics. From [the engineering of fighter planes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wk6Qr6OO5Xo) to [flood control systems in The Netherlands](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6DRRHXt-PA).

[Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCBa659QWEk1AI4Tg--mrJ2A)
: Popular channel mostly focusing on talking about random interesting places with neat stories around the world.

[You Suck At Cooking](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCekQr9znsk2vWxBo3YiLq2w)
: Funny comedy cooking videos that are actual recipes. Videos vary on how much they focus on being funny vs teaching good recipes. [This one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GYl7h8iDjsY) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3DPH3KOiXk) are pretty good.


# C Tier: Someone being really good at something

[Pannen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC5miyvhPsWWyfTulnJ43koQ)
: Details various glitches used for an automated Super Mario 64 speedrun where he tries to minimize use of the A (jump) button. Really interesting just seeing how insane the tricks can be. Best and most famous video is [this commentated one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpk2tdsPh0A) from his other channel about paralell universes.

[Daniel Schiffer](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwjZLzqHYImv4oCJQcZ8Hig)
: Videographer who goes into how he shoots and edits commercials, and he's really good at it so his videos are great.

[Tucker Gott](https://www.youtube.com/user/J3Cub2009)
: Paramotor pilot. I have no plans on ever paramotoring but it's cool to watch and his "Reacting To Crash Videos" series is really interesting, seeing him break down what kind of safety considerations come into play and how things can go wrong.

[GeoWizard](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCW5OrUZ4SeUYkUg1XqcjFYA)
: Guy who is really good at GeoGuessr, that is super knowledgeable about geography and all sorts of tricks to figure out where you are when plopped randomly on Street View. [This guy](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7ELHo7almKFfxe8ultFdTA) is allegedly better but IMO less entertaining.

[Media Molecule](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCtQvv0QrY7_W49gtIPSDWdg)
: Lots of videos about [Dreams](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/dreams-ps4/), the most impressive feat of software engineering I can think of, but that's another potential future article. Includes compilations of cool creations, tutorials from talented artists, and explanations by developers of how it works.

[Jonathan Blow](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCuoqzrsHlwv1YyPKLuMDUQ)
: Recorded live streams of programming and demoing his game and new programming language/compiler. Clearly very skilled, also overly brash at times, but his ideas and perspective is interesting and his videos are the only ones I watch of live programming.

[Sethbling](https://www.youtube.com/user/sethbling)
: Does Super Mario World speedruns involving code injection via carefully placed shells and a glitch to warp directly to the credits, as well as various other technical video game trickery.

[Harstem](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCRdB9rqzP2m7bPYb5drH_Q)
: Professional StarCraft 2 player. Critiques people's submitted replays, plays serious games while explaining his thoughts, tries playing with terrible strategies and winning purely on having better mechanics.
